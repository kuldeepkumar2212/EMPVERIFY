## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/kuldeepkumar2212/EMPVERIFY`

2. Open `Ganache` and create a new Project

3. Install MetaMask in browser and import the local blockchain network details from 'Ganache'
 - ( Top Left Corner > Add Network > Add netwotk Manually > Add `RPC URL` link (from Ganache) > save > Switch to the Ganache network)
4. Import Required accounts from Ganache to MetaMask (required)

5. Open terminal and run `ipfs daemon`

6. Install dependencies:
    `npm install` or `yarn install`
   
7.  Compile the contract using:
    - `npm run compile`
- (Copy the created contract address from "Transactions" tab in `Ganache` and paste in .env)
    
8. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
 - `ADMIN_ADDRESS=` ->(First account in Ganache)
 - `CONTRACT_ADDRESS=`
 - `MONGO_URI=`
   
4. Run the development server:
   - `npm run dev`

5. Access the application:
Server running on `http://localhost:3000` 



## Usage
- Admin logins and able to add Organizations.
- Once when admin adds organization only then organization can login (No self registration).
- Then Orgs can add its Employees and their documents where documents are saved in IPFS with corresponding employee detail.
- (No self Registration for Employee) Employee can view his/her documents in profile and check for any requests for docs by verifier.
- Verfier register himself and then using wallet address of the employee the verifier can request  required documents for that particulat employee.
- Employee can able to Accept or Revoke the request by verifier
- The document Link shared to verifier is a `Temporary Link` and after `Revoked` by employeee the link will be expired.
